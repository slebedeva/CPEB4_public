# CPEB4_public
Code to create figures for the CPEB4 manuscript.


Start with manuscript_figures.R. Make sure that you have Bioconductor installed. 

The script will try to install R packages that are missing (but may fail due to dependencies).

The script should produce a "plots" folder with pdf images of raw figure panels as well as "source_data" folder with the csv files that were used for plots.
